"a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support "
"its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite "
"the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many "
"of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have "
"included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, "
"Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel "
"Kahneman.The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, "
"British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED "
"Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides "
"subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from "
"volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established "
"the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change "
"the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which "
"supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style "
"events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing "
"innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable "
"projects and activities."

"Enigma: that which is difficult to interpret, that which remains a mystery, "
"something uncertain or inexplicable, a riddle not yet solved. <br> <br> The "
"<i>uncertain</i>, the <i>paradox</i>, the <i>unsolved</i>. <br> <br> It’s "
"everywhere. From the grandest existential question, to the tiniest everyday "
"query, enigma is the source of knowledge. <br> <br>A man-made invention, a "
"problem man places upon himself. An innate need for answers, which builds "
"superstructures: physics, biology, computer science, chemistry, astronomy, "
"arts, philosophy, history, psychology, sociology, religion, politics. <br> "
"<br> Every answer creates a new question, and leads the way to a new "
"explanation, more updated, more satisfactory, more complete. The enigma is "
"in search of a solution to what troubles the human mind, and the enigma is "
"everything that troubles the human mind, at the same time. It’s the way of "
"facing the world without the possibility of being wrong. It’s a positive "
"perspective of an uncertain reality. The admiration of the enormous progress "
"of humanity. <br> <br> An attempt of self-awareness. <br> <br>  We can climb "
"the mount of knowledge, one enigma at a time."
