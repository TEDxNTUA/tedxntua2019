"TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as "
"a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support "
"its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite "
"the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many "
"of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have "
"included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, "
"Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel "
"Kahneman.The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, "
"British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED "
"Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides "
"subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from "
"volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established "
"the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change "
"the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which "
"supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style "
"events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing "
"innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable "
"projects and activities."

"In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-"
"organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. "
"At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep "
"discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded "
"TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference "
"provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx event "
"are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)"

"The various activities of the students and the academic community in general "
"in the National Technical University of Athens are proof of creativity "
"endemic. This scientific potential is the fundamental material for the "
"creation of progressive ideas, which are capable of following the current "
"advancements in science and technology. Nonetheless, the massive immigration "
"of young graduates towards the flourishing economies of the world, the "
"appearance of numerous new fields, the need for highly specialized "
"scientists and employees, the general sense of individualism and especially "
"the pervasive economical and ethical crisis have deprived the academic "
"community of the collaborative spirit necessary in every learning "
"experience. TEDxNTUA is an organized effort to create and sustain the "
"necessary frame for the exchange of new ideas in the fields of technology "
"and business administration. At the same time, NTUA’s community is becoming "
"a living, extrovert organism focusing on the scientific and career goals of "
"its members, while promoting the expansion of the network of collaboration "
"between the NTUA, the industries and the startup community."
