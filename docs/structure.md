* `assets/`  
  Project-level CSS and JS scripts. For documentation on the bundling process, check [here](webpack/index.md).

  Extra files that accompany the project, such as configuration of external tools etc.

    * [`home/`](home/index.md)
    * [`program/`](program/index.md)
    * [`team/`](team/index.md)
    * [`about/`](about/index.md)
