'''
Models for the "Program" section of the website.

The event consists of Activities presented by Presenters, where each activity
happens on one of the three stages: Main event, Performances, Side events.

In this module you'll find:
- Django models for each entity.
- Post-save signal receivers that generate thumbnails for each entry's image.
- Helper managers for queries like "get all presenters who are speakers".
- The `get_schedule` method of the ActivityManager. It gets all the activities
  and organizes them by start time and stage in order to produce the schedule
  that will be consumed by the ScheduleView.
